      <h2>Camp Lajas Counselor</h2>
      <p>Want to do something meaningful this summer? Join our team! We are still seeking college students and young adults to serve as camp counselors on each week of Camp Lajas in July 2021. Camp Lajas (la-haas) is a 5-night adventure camp for young men and women entering 10th grade through graduated seniors. Campers will sleep in a teepee, learn to shoot a bow and arrow, kayak, rock-climb, hike, whitewater raft, and encounter God in adventure, worship, and the Sacraments.</p>
      <p>Counselors may volunteer on a weekly basis. Counselor and staffer positions are available. For more information, email lajas@drybonespgh.org, and check out our website at www.camplajas.org.</p>
