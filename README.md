# Project 3: Website Portfolio - Volunteering With Us!

I created this website as a one-stop-shop for all things Volunteering with a club I am involved in.  I noticed through fellow students that information about volunteering opportunities was not always readily available, and tended to be hard to find online.  Also, students have stated they would volunteer more frequently if the information about upcoming volunteer opportunities were able to be found online and located easily and quickly.  In making this website, I hoped to create a platform that would make this possible, encouraging students to reach out to their communities and get involved in any way possible.
